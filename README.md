# Pricecharting Scripts

These are some scripts to help compare prices, not much atm

## Per Console

```bash
./super-nintendo.sh
```

## Get Any

```bash
./get-any.sh
```

With this one you will prompted to list your console. Right now you can enter most Nintendo Ones,
 but be sure to enter the right name. For example Virtual Boy or Super Nintendo or NES.
 
 You will then be prompted if you want to compare with older prices. You can say Yes or No
