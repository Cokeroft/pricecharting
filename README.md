# Pricecharting Scripts

These are some scripts to help compare prices, not much atm


## Get Any From CSV

```bash
./get_any_csv.py
```

You can enter most consoles, but they must be entered correctly. 
For example Virtual Boy or Super Nintendo or NES.
 
 You will then be prompted if you want to compare with older prices. You can say Yes or No
 
 ## Get Prices
 
 ```bash
 ./get_prices_all.py
 ```
 
 This will create the prices file for the current day for all games from Nintendo, Sony, Sega, 
 Microsoft, and other misc items such as Amiibo and Nintendo Power.
 
 ## Get Data
 ```bash
 ./get_data.py
 ```
 
 This will get the data IDs used for API searching for a specific console. In the future,
 I'll update this to be able to find a specific ID based off console.
 
 ## Search
 
 ```bash
 ./tbd.py
 ```
 
 This is a WIP, and will allow you to search for products using the API
